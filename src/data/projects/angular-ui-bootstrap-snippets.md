I wrote some code snippets for VS Code for users of the [UI Bootstrap library](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) for AngularJS. It’s not much, but it seems quite popular, with over 200,000 installations in the VS Code extension marketplace!

Fun fact: I originally wrote the snippets for the Atom editor, which no longer exists.
