> **🚧 Update:** Unfortunately, Omnivore shut down, which makes the extension useless for now.

I’ve recently released my first browser extension: Omnivore List Popup! It’s available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/omnivore-list-popup/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnivore-list-popup/dnfckbihnohkfoaclfckbcebclmhleni) (and other Chromium-based browsers, like Vivaldi).

In the past, I’ve been using Pocket for temporarily storing pages (as a _read-it-later_ tool). Recently, I switched to the open-source app [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app). But there was one problem: I really missed using my favorite browser extension [In My Pocket](https://inmypocketaddon.com/), which is only available for Pocket’s API. So, I built my own extension to replicate my favorite functionality from In My Pocket for the new Omnivore platform!

So far, I’ve received good feedback from the Omnivore community, and I’m a happy user among a few other users (according to the extension stats)!
