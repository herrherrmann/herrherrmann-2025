Is it really called "Unzip Tool"? Or rather (un-)archive software? Anyway, I guess you're already aware of what I'm referring to. Since Mac OS X doesn't provide the capability of extracting (or creating) certain archive types like rar or 7zip, you'd really need some third-party software for that.

The real struggle is now: Do I choose the (boring) [Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353 "The Unarchiver Website") or the recently discovered [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/ "Keka Website") with such a cool app icon?

But wait, there's more: [iZip](https://www.izip.com/ "iZip Website") and UnRarX (down by now) also seems to deliver the same features! Oh well, I'll probably just stay with the tool which has the [better symbol](http://forum.kekaosx.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1421).
