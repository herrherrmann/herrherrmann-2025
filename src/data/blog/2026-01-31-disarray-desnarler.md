I recently joined my friend [Urs](https://www.instagram.com/the.not.so.distant.future/)’ workshop to build a little macro ~~keyboard~~ pad, the DisArray Desnarler!

It was a lot of fun doing some soldering, which I hadn’t done in quite a while (there are a few unfinished/unstarted projects lying around at home). A workshop is a great excuse to get out and do stuff in a focused environment, while also meeting people and have fun. :)

The DisArray Desnarler is a little device with 4 full-size keys and a fader that connects to your keyboard via USB – basically, a miniature keyboard. It can be (or: has to be!) [programmed](https://github.com/ZenVega/disarray_desnarler_docs) to suit your needs. I still have some work to do to make it useful for my macOS devices. Although I have to admit that I’m already happily using the macro keys and rotary encoders on my [regular keyboard](https://keychron.de/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard-iso-layout-collection?variant=41321619980425), which makes it harder to justify using the Desnarler in combination with it. That being said, I might look into using it as a _musical_ input device (Urs has worked on a similar project to turn it into a chord generator)!
