Since I've been using a lot of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recently, I decided to port my existing Atom package [Angular-Bootstrap](https://atom.io/packages/angular-bootstrap) to VS Code in order to access the snippets there as well. So that happened yesterday and now you can find the extension in the extension marketplace: [Angular UI Bootstrap Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=herrherrmann.angular-bootstrap). I hope it's useful!
