I’ve finally found the motivation to compile a list of my favorite websites! These following pages are very cool™ because they either look super nice, offer great content or do both. And they don’t feature the current trends that make the web worse: Offensive advertising, affiliate-based opinion making, obsessive user tracking. Let’s get started.

## [It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/)

![It’s Nice That website with several articles and nice imagery.](images/its-nice-that-800x680.jpg)

A great design magazine covering a diverse range of topics that are somehow _all_ super interesting and informative. It’s very easy to browse and also find older gems and inspiration on there. Instead of relying on advertising, they recently launched their own [premium subscription option](https://www.itsnicethat.com/extranice).

## [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/)

![A List Apart website with the categories "Code", "Content", "Design" and "Industry & Business".](images/a-list-apart-800x542.jpg)

Another web magazine that doesn’t try to sell you the latest framework or library but focuses on more cultural and psychological topics of web design and development. They also run a great series of mini books about these topics, [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/).

## [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

![Glitch website saying "Glitch is the friendly community where everyone codes together!!".](images/glitch-800x452.jpg)

Glitch is a developer-centric community and collaborative code editor that invites everyone to experiment and “remix” ideas from each other. I love their playful colors, thick borders and overall aesthetics.

## [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

![Coolors website with a warm color palette.](images/coolors-800x444.jpg)

At heart, Coolors is “just” a color palette generator but it executes this idea so well that I keep going back to it, even for simple tasks like creating some variations of a base color. You can also just open their [generator](https://coolors.co/generate) and keep pressing spacebar until you stumble upon a nice color combination.

## [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)

![Bandcamp website with a headline saying: "Bandcamp Vinyl Pressing Service is Here, and It Works".](images/bandcamp-800x582.jpg)

Bandcamp is my favorite way of purchasing music nowadays. A lot of my favorite artists do sell their albums there in a digital and/or physical format, it’s a transparent company that genuinely seems to care about creativity and artists and they offer more and more cool features like their blog ([Bandamp Daily](https://daily.bandcamp.com/)) and web radio ([Bandcamp Weekly](https://bandcamp.com/?show=414)).

That’s it for this year!
