For the past year I've been using [Atom](https://atom.io/) on a nearly daily basis. Despite its sluggishness it quickly became my editor of choice thanks to many [packages](https://atom.io/users/herrherrmann/stars) that are improving my workflow. I'm often using AngularJS and the UI Bootstrap components for my projects, so I decided to write my own Atom package full of snippets and auto-completions for that exact (and obviously popular) combination of frameworks. It's appropriately called [Angular-Bootstrap](https://atom.io/users/herrherrmann/stars) and received 171 downloads by now! It's far from done (many components and documentation are still missing) but seeing it being downloaded and used by other people clearly increases my motivation to maintain it over a longer time.

So – if you're one of its users – thanks for using my package and don't hesitate to leave feedback in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/herrherrmann/angular-bootstrap)!
