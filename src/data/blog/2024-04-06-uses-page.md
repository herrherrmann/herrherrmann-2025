My website has a [/uses page](/uses) now! Check it out if you’re interested in the gear and (software) tools I’m using. In the future, I might add more details and even photos of my desk setup.

The concept of a /uses page is quite popular among developer websites, and many people are having one nowadays. You can check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) to find a list of other people’s pages.
