A few days ago I released a new EP as bm_128 called “A New EP in 2023”! This release focuses more on the post-rock genre, and the electronic aspects are a bit deemphasized this time.

It’s available on all kinds of streaming platforms: [Bandcamp](https://bm128.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-ep-in-2023), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/album/a-new-ep-in-2023/1721727147), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7IiAFB1JyfPmedPzQa3EoH), [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/335558041), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bm_128/sets/a-new-ep-in-2023), and others! Here’s a handy overview to see all available platforms: [https://album.link/i/1721727147](https://album.link/i/1721727147) – And you can also download it for free right here on the [music page](/music/).

Enjoy! 🎵
