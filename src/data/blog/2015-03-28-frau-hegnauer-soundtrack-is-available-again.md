I noticed one of the theater soundtracks I made (for the drama "Frau Hegnauer kommt") has not been available online for some time. That’s because the corresponding website was shut down since the piece is not being played anymore.

<!-- TODO: Add link/embed to download the album. -->

Anyway, I’ve got my own website and it’s a good place to put it up again: _Download coming back up soon._

P.S.: [Trailer #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfOVhQQKRgw "Frau Hegnauer kommt Trailer") and [Trailer #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAvyqSZR0V4 "Another Frau Hegnauer kommt Trailer!").
