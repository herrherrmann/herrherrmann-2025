Hello, I’m Sebastian. 👋

I’m a software developer from Berlin, Germany. Currently, I’m working for [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com/), and I’m building smaller [software projects](/projects) in my free time.

I love collaborating in small teams on impactful and creative projects. I care deeply about quality, sustainability, and accessibility. And I’m a believer in continuous learning, staying humble and letting the best ideas win.

I’m also making music under the name [bm_128](/music/bm_128) and as part of the band [MØDI](/music/modi). And I [take photos](/photos)!

If you think I can help you out as a developer or musician, please [let me know](/contact) (no recruiters, please).

## What’s this website for?

This website serves as a digital portfolio, as well as a platform for my thoughts about software development, web design, and other random topics. And it allows you to [get in touch](/contact) with me if you are interested in working together. If you want to follow me on other platforms, you can check the links in the footer.

Enjoy your stay, and thanks for reading!
