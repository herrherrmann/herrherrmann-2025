        I’ve been building websites for quite a while now. Originally starting with simple HTML and CSS in the early
        2000s, I’ve soon started leveraging WordPress and eventually JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS and React to
        build responsive and intuitive web apps. Nowadays, my favorite stack revolves around TypeScript, React and
        server-side rendering with Next.js – Although I definitely enjoy vanilla JavaScript and Vue.js, too!

        at the selection of projects below.
